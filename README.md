# CS252
This is a repository for all projects that I created during the duration of CS252. 
Quite a lot of them have a massive amount of code.

# LAB 1: Malloc
Description: In malloc, I was tasked to create a mallocing function that helps efficiently call memory by creating a wrapper
for the sbrk function that allows for one to efficiently recall memory that is no longer in use.

Languages: C
