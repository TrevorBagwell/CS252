# CS252
This is a repository for all projects that I created during the duration of CS252. 
Quite a lot of them have a massive amount of code.

# LAB 1: Malloc
Description: 
In malloc, I was tasked to create a mallocing function that helps efficiently call memory by creating a wrapper in C
for the sbrk function that allows for one to efficiently recall memory that is no longer in use.

Languages: C

# LAB 3: Shell
Description: 
In shell, I created a lexigraphical parser using lex and yacc that is able to interpret shell commands and convert them into actions and then subsequentally handle them in C++. I was successfully able to also make a class for handling pipes and a class for handling folder traversal.

Languages: C, C++, Lex, Yacc

# LAB 5: Web Server
Description:
In the web server, I created a completely localled hosted C++ server on the local end that is able to interpret requests using many of the sys and unistd libraryies' C functions. 

Languages: C, C++
